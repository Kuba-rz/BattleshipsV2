# BattleshipsV2
A smiple console application for playing the battleships game. 

This application was created for me to get familiar with, and practice the new concept for me which is working in a TDD fashion.

To get started and play the game, simply download the zip folder, unzip it and open it in an IDE.

Having node installed, type 'node app.js' in the console.

The game has started, a 10x10 grid has been created, 3 ships (2 destroyers 1 battleship) have 
been placed in random locations on the grid. Try to hit them all by typing commands in the console,
in the form of the square on the grid you want to target. For example 'A5'. Values from A-J and 1-10
are accepted. Press 'q' at any time to quit the game.

After you sink all of the ships, the game will end.
